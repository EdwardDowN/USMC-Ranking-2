Go back to the application page on the developer portal and make sure you are copying the TOKEN into your config file. Not the client ID and not the client secret. The token.

## Bad cookie.
Get a new cookie for your Roblox bot and this time do not press sign out of the account. Just close the tab and put the cookie into the config either manually or through the installer (select update the cookie when it asks what you are using this tool to do). Once the bot has started if you go back to the Roblox website you will be on the login page where you can continue to use Roblox normally.
